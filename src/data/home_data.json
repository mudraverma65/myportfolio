		"about": "I found my passion for coding through a movie. The movie depicted how our entire universe is a simulation written in code and monitored by other beings... it was the 'The Matrix'. After watching the movie my 10 year old self was certain nothing is real and I started learning 'C'. Fastforward to present, where I have been liberated but my interest persisted and I decided to do my bachelors in Computer Science. I love competetive coding and have participated in numerous Hackathons winning a few along the way. My full time internship taught be workplace culture where I also got the opportunity to lead a team of developers in numerous projects. Fixated on taking my passion forward I am currently pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University."
